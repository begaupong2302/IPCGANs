# IPCGANs

## Introduction
This project is an implementation based on the [Identity-Preserved Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/papers/Wang_Face_Aging_With_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf).

## Dataset
The datasets utilized in this project include:
- [UTKFace Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jangedoo/utkface-new/data): a large-scale face dataset with long age span (range from 0 to 116 years old). The dataset consists of over 20,000 face images with annotations of age, gender, and ethnicity.
- [AffectNet Training Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/noamsegal/affectnet-training-data): contains approximately 30,000 facial RGB images of different expressions with size restricted to 48Ã—48, and the main labels of it can be divided into 7 types: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Neutral.
